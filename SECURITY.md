# QBitcoin Security Considerations

This document outlines the security features, considerations, and limitations of the QBitcoin implementation.

## Security Features

### Quantum Resistance

QBitcoin implements several post-quantum cryptographic primitives:

1. **SPHINCS+**: A stateless hash-based signature scheme that is believed to be quantum-resistant.
2. **Argon2 Proof-of-Work**: A memory-hard function that is resistant to ASICs and potentially quantum algorithms.
3. **SHA-3**: A modern hash function more resilient to theoretical quantum attacks than SHA-2.

### Chain Security

1. **Block Validation**: Blocks must have valid proof-of-work, transactions, and references to previous blocks.
2. **Transaction Validation**: All transactions are validated for proper signatures, balance checks, and double-spending prevention.
3. **Longest Chain Rule**: QBitcoin follows the longest valid chain, providing basic protection against forks.

## Deployment Recommendations

### Using the Wrapper Script

Always use the provided `run_qbitcoin.sh` wrapper script to run QBitcoin. This ensures:

1. **Dependency Isolation**: All dependencies run in a virtual environment
2. **Consistent Execution**: Commands always run in the same environment
3. **Proper Library Loading**: Ensures cryptographic libraries are loaded correctly

### Multi-Node Security

When running multiple nodes:

1. **Port Security**: Only expose necessary ports (default: 9333) in your firewall
2. **Host Binding**: Use `--host 127.0.0.1` for nodes that should only be accessible locally
3. **Network Isolation**: Consider running nodes in separate network namespaces or containers for additional isolation

## Limitations and Considerations

This implementation is for educational purposes and has several security limitations:

1. **Simplified Consensus**: The consensus mechanism lacks some of the robustness of production cryptocurrencies.
2. **Limited Fork Handling**: The implementation has basic fork resolution based on the longest chain rule.
3. **No Confirmation Depth**: Unlike Bitcoin which recommends 6 confirmations, there's no formal confirmation depth guidance.
4. **Account-Based Model**: Uses a simpler account model rather than Bitcoin's UTXO model, which may have implications for certain types of attacks.
5. **51% Attack Vulnerability**: Like most proof-of-work blockchains, QBitcoin is theoretically vulnerable to 51% attacks.
6. **Development Status**: This is an educational implementation, not a battle-tested production system.

## Security Recommendations

When deploying QBitcoin:

1. **Back Up Wallet Files**: Private keys are stored in the wallet files and should be backed up securely.
2. **Wait for Multiple Confirmations**: For important transactions, wait for several block confirmations.
3. **Secure RPC Access**: If enabled, ensure RPC access is properly secured with strong credentials.
4. **Firewall Configuration**: Use proper firewall rules to protect nodes from unauthorized access.
5. **Regular Backups**: Regularly back up blockchain and wallet data.
6. **Environment Isolation**: Run QBitcoin in isolated environments (virtual environments, containers, or VMs).
7. **Dependency Management**: Always use the wrapper script to ensure dependencies are correctly loaded.
